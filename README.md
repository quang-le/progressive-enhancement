1. Description
Series of exercises done sprint-style to get a hold of html and css.
I've only kept the one called "turlututu" as it was the most complex one, it encompassed all that had been done before, and is the only one that is not desperately ugly.
[Full instructions (in french) here](https://github.com/becodeorg/lovelace-2/tree/master/Parcours/01-La-prairie/html-css/progressive-enhancement).

2. The "turlututu" exercise
The idea was that we were provided an image and we had to reproduce the layout, with bonus points for responsiveness.
I just kept the general layout, but changed the color chart and theme, as a way to have a bit of fun with a dry exercise.

I just used vanilla css (no Bootstrap or SASS).

I tried to use as many features as possible: I used a grid to structure one section and a flexbox for another, and made the page responsive with media queries.

3. Outcomes
* Used all css features shown in the sprint
* Responsive design, but not mobile first: I scaled down the PC version of the page.
* Looked for unique font
* Found color charter using Adobe tool
